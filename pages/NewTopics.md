### Summary

The research carried out by the members of the Plume team is mostly centered on two strongly intertwined themes: the _foundation of programming languages_ (design, semantics, implementation, etc) and the _theory of computing systems_ (compositional analysis, security, verification).

International conferences announcing novel results in these areas include: LICS, ICALP, POPL, CONCUR, CSL, ETAPS.

#### Theme 1: The foundation of programming languages

Our work in this rather large area of research has focused on the study, design and application of _logics_ and _type systems_ for programming languages and on _concurrent games_.   

##### Lambda calculus

##### Linear Logic

##### Implicit Computational Complexity

##### Game Semantics


#### Theme 2: Theory of computing systems

Within this broad area of research we are interested in _concurrency theory_  which we explore by applying and developing logica-based ideas the fields such as _category theory_ of _game theory_ and _automata theory_ and _logic_.
