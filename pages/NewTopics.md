The research carried out by the members of the Plume team is mostly centered on two strongly intertwined themes: the _foundations of programming languages_ (design, semantics, implementation, etc) and the _theory of computing systems_ (compositional analysis, security, verification).

International conferences announcing novel results in these areas include: LICS, ICALP, POPL, CONCUR, CSL, ETAPS, MFCS, MFPS, CALCO.

## Theme 1: The Foundations of Programming Languages

Our work in this area of research has focused on the study, design and application of _logics_ and _type systems_ for programming languages and on _concurrent games_.   

**Lambda calculus**

**Linear Logic**

**Implicit Computational Complexity**

**Game Semantics**


## Theme 2: Theory of Computing Systems

Within this broad area of research we are mostly interested in _concurrency theory_  which we explore by applying and developing logica-based ideas the fields such as _category theory_, _game theory_, _automata theory_ and _logic_.


**Coinduction.**

**Rule-based modeling.**

**Mechanisation of reasonings about behaviours of concurrent systems.**

**Kleene Algebra**

**Monadic Second Order Logic.**
Büchi's and Rabin's theorem (1962,1969) constitute fundamental theoretical results and are at the basis of numerous formal verification tools for concurrent systems. Our recent research results on MSO include: full axiomatizations (Riba, Das), new model theoretic proof of classical results (Riba), Lebesgue measurability and closure-properties of regular sets of trees (Mio), algorithms for computing the probability of regular sets of trees (Mio).
